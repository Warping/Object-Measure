# Object-Measure

This project is a **computer vision-based measurement tool** that processes a video to detect, classify, and measure three types of objects:
- **Washers**
- **Screws**
- **Hex nuts**

Using a known reference object (a red object of known width), the script calculates the real-world dimensions of the objects in inches and reports measurement accuracy across the video frames.

## üìù Features

- Detects reference objects based on red color masking.
- Identifies and classifies:
  - Washers (roughly circular with small area)
  - Screws (long, narrow shapes)
  - Hex nuts (small area, not overlapping other objects)
- Measures width and height of each object.
- Computes average dimensions for each object type.
- Calculates measurement errors compared to known dimensions.
- Supports interactive pausing (`p` key) and quitting (`q` key) while processing the video.

## üîß Requirements

Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- `opencv-python`
- `imutils`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils numpy scipy
